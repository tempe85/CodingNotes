# Kubernetes (K8s)

`Container`

## Docker

-
- Helps manage compatibility issues with libraries, dependencies, OS and hardware
- Helps onboard new devs with their new environments
- Ensures that the application runs the same way on different user systems

- Each developer can run containers using a simple `docker run` command
- Docker containers share the underlying kernel.
- Containers vs virtual machines
  - Containers
    - Hardware -> OS -> Docker -> Containers (Libraries + Depedencies/Applications)
    - Cannot have more than one OS since it shares the underlying OS kernel
  - Virtual machines
    - Hardware
    - OS
    - Hypervisor
    - Virtual Machine (OS/(Libraries + Depedencies/Applications))
      - Virtual machine has its own OS running on it which makes it a much bigger size.
      - Can have many different OS's

`images` - Package/Template used to create one or more containers

`containers` - Running instances of images that are isolated that have their own environments and set of processes.

## Container Orchestration

<img src="./../../../images/kubernetes_beginner_orchestration.png">

- Auto scale up and down containers based on the load

- Orechestration techs
  - Docker swarm
  - Kubernetes
  - MESOS

## Kubernetes

- Container orchestration technology

### Kubernetes architecture

`Node` - Physical or virtual machine in which kubernetes is installed. Also known as 'minions'.
`Cluster` - Set of nodes grouped together. If one node fails the application is still available from the other nodes. Shares load.
`Master` - A node with kubernetes installed. Watches over the nodes in the cluster and is responsible for orchestration of the containers on the cluster nodes.

### Master vs worker nodes

Worker node

- Container runtime engine
- Kubelet agent

Master node

- Kube-apiserver
- etcd
  - Key value store
- controller
- scheduler

### kubectl

- Kube Command line tool
- Gets cluster information

`kubectl run hello-minikube` - Deploys a node

`kubectl cluster-info`

`kubectl get nodes`

### docker vs containerD

- kubernetes was originally designed to support docker containers
  - container runtime interface (CRI)
    - Allowed kubernetes to work with any container runtime as long as they employed the Open Container Initiative (OCI)
      - Docker doesn't implement OCI but kubernetes used dockershim to continue to support it
        - Eventually stopped supporting dockershim
      - ContainerD uses OCI and can be supported by kubernetes
- crictl
  - interacts with CRI compatible runtimes

## Pods

- A single instance of an application. The smallest object you can create in kubernetes.
- Inside of a node
- 1-1 relationship with a container
- To increase load for your application, you can have multiple pods running in the same node
  - Can deploy a new node in the cluster if you run out resources on a node
  - Do not add additional containers in an existing pod
    Multi-container PODs
- Can have two different containers in the same pod if they are different application
- Share network and storage space

  - Kubernetes helps manage pods with containers and helper containers working together

  `kubectl run nginx --image nginx`

  - Deploys a pod
  - Downloads from a private or public hub with the container

Using docker for minikube: `minikube start --driver=docker`

Minikube status: `minikube status`

Creating a pod: `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`

- Example creates an nginx pod. Pulls from docker images

Create a deploying using imperative command: `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`

Get pod information: `kubectl describe pod <podname>`

Get additional pod information: `kubectl get pods -o wide`

- Gives information on what node the pod is running
- Gives IP address info (internal IP in the kubernetes cluster)
