### Very complex

- Many standards needing to communicate with each other

| `Network`  | System for connecting computers using a `single transmission technology`                                                                             |
| `Internet` | Set of networks connected by routers that are configured to communicate among a `variety of network transmission technologies` (Network of networks) |
| `Ethernet` | Networking standard                                                                                                                                  |
| `TCP/IP`   | Protocol made internetworking possible. Transmission control protocol / Internet protocol                                                            |

`Packet switches` - Chunks of data sent by routers

`Speed` - Measure in electronic units

- K = 10^3
- M = 10^6
- G = 10^9
- E.g. network speed of 8Mbps means 8,000,000 bits per second

`Size` bits, bytes measured in binary units

- Ki = 2^10, M = 2^20, G = 2^30
- E.g. disk size of 200GiB means 200 x 20^30 Bytes = 214.... Bytes

- Bytes and bits
  - Use lower case `b` for bits
  - Upper case `B` for Bytes
  - Example: 1 Mib = 128 KiB
