Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is _actually_ written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
