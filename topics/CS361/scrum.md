| `Scrum`              | Lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.                                                                 |
| `Product Goal`       | Future state of the product which can serve as a target for the scrum team to plan against. Vehicle to deliver value, has a clear boundary, known stackholders, and well-defined users/cusomers. |
| `Increment`          | A single concrete stepping stone toward the product goal. Must be useable.                                                                                                                       |
| `Definition of Done` | Formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.                                                                                    |

### Scrum process

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

4. Repeat

## Three pillars of scrum:

- Transparency
  - Agreed upon goals.
  - Important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts.
- Inspection
  - Allows adaptation.
  - Artifacts must be inspected frequently
- Adaptation
  - Adjustments if out of standards. Must be done early in the process.

### Scrum Team

- Scrum master, product owner and developers.
  - Product owner
    - Set product goals
    - Communicate product backlog items
    - Ensuring backlog is transparent and understood
  - Scrum master
    - Establishes a scrum
    - Coaches team members
    - Ensuring productivity
    - Training on scrum

### The sprint

- Fixed length events of 1 month or less
- Sprint planning
  - Lays out the work to be performed for the sprint
  - Defines:
    - Why sprint is valuable
    - What can be done during the sprint
    - How will the work get done
- Daily scrum
  - Purpose is to inspect progress toward the sprint
- Sprint review
  - Present progfress of work to stakeholders
- Sprint retrospective
  - Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness

### Scrum Artifacts

- The work or value being done.
- Each artifact contains a commitment
  - Product backlog it is the product goal
  - Sprint backlog it is the sprint goal
  - Increment it is the Definition of Done

### Product backlog

- Ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
- Backlog items that can be done within one sprint are ready for selection during sprint planning
  - Otherwise they need to be broken down into smaller pieces.

### Sprint backlog

- Sprint goal, product backlog items selected for the sprint, and actionable plan for delivering Increment.
- Need to keep the sprint goal in mind (the single objective for the sprint)
